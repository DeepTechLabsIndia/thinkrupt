🤖 Disruptive Thinking. Indigenous Intelligence.
Under the banner of the DeepTech AI Community, we are launching Thinkrupt — an open-source AI initiative focused on building a multilingual, multi-modal large language model tailored for India. 🇮🇳

✨ Why Thinkrupt?
Because it’s time India created its own AI — trained on our languages, tuned for our problems, and open to everyone.

🌍 Our Goals:
✅ Understand and generate content in Indian languages

✅ Interpret visual data (forms, documents, charts, crop images)

✅ Assist in domains like education, law, governance, and agriculture

✅ Be lightweight, ethical, and accessible to all

💡 What We're Building
We are forming a student-powered research task force to lead work across:

🔧 LLM fine-tuning using QLoRA & Hugging Face

📚 Curation of domain-rich, instruction-ready datasets

🖼️ Vision-language integration (e.g., LLaVA-style)

🌐 Web deployment using Gradio or Streamlit

📊 Research benchmarking and publication

📢 Who Should Join?
If you're passionate about:

🧠 Natural Language Processing (NLP)

🤖 Machine Learning / Computer Vision

🛠️ Open-source development

🇮🇳 Solving real Indian problems with real AI...

Then you're already one of us.
